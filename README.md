# SAITAP – Smart AR/VR Industrial Training & Assistance Platform 🏭
**Gamified AR/VR Workforce Training for Safer Industrial Operations**

SAITAP (Smart AR/VR Industrial Training & Assistance Platform) is an immersive industrial training ecosystem that enables workers to learn machine operations through **AI-powered recognition, AR step-by-step guidance, and VR-based simulation labs**. The platform transforms traditional manual-based industrial training into a **safe, interactive, and multilingual digital learning experience**.

## 🚀 The Problem
Industrial training today still relies heavily on:
- Static manuals and classroom sessions
- Limited hands-on practice opportunities
- Language barriers for workers
- High accident risks during early-stage machine exposure

This results in **low skill retention, inconsistent training quality, and increased workplace hazards**.

## ✨ Our Solution: "AI-Driven Immersive Industrial Training"
SAITAP introduces a smart AR/VR-enabled training pipeline:

1. **Machine Recognition:** Workers capture a machine image; YOLO + TensorFlow identify the equipment automatically.
2. **Simulation Generation:** The system loads the corresponding VR training module for safe practice.
3. **AR Operational Assistance:** Real-time AR overlays provide step-by-step operational guidance and safety zones.
4. **Safety Intelligence:** PPE reminders and hazard alerts appear dynamically during tasks.
5. **Training Analytics:** Supervisors monitor progress, certification, and compliance through dashboards.
